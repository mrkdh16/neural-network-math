# Neural network from scratch for handwritten digit recognition (with all the math explanation)

With no prior experience in machine learning, I decided to try learning the math behind neural networks and create a simple neural network with no high-level libraries. The only packages
used are numpy, pandas, and matplotlib (+sys). 

I learned all the math from 3Blue1Brown's series of articles and videos on neural networks, and the free neural networks and deep learning online textbook (linked below). Almost all the 
code was copied directly from Samson Zhang's YouTube video with some of it modified in a way that makes more sense to me personally (linked below). The math exposition and latex was written 
by your truly.
